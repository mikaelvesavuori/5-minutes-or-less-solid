/**
 * **Open-Closed Principle**
 *
 * You've maybe heard some variant of how a module
 *
 * > "[...] should be open for extension and closed for modification."
 *
 * This principle is closely related to polymorphism, as we use
 * an abstraction (the Toy, in this case) to fulfill our principle.
 *
 * In terms of the "open" and "closed" notions, this can be more easily
 * understood if you think of "open for extension" as referring to
 * the abstractions, rather than the concrete implementation. Thus,
 * you build new classes (such as a `CuddlyBear`) that implements the
 * Toy abstraction; i.e. they are "open for extension". This keeps the
 * unique properties and implementation details of each Toy discrete;
 * i.e. they are "closed for modification".
 *
 * @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openâ€“closed_principle

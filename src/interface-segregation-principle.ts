/**
 * **Interface Segregation Principle**
 *
 * Use interfaces (or similar constructs) to separate the
 * logic and functionality of code to better express it
 * as clean divisions. This way, classes (etc.) can use and
 * know about only what they need.
 *
 * In the example we'll use interfaces to express different
 * performance talents. We'll set up a dancer as well as a
 * multi-talented performer. Technically, giving them different
 * sets of skills is merely a matter of implementing one or more
 * interfaces.
 *
 * The counter-point to this specific tactic is that it inheritance
 * can go overboard.
 *
 * Joe Armstrong, creator of Erlang, famously stated his opinion that,
 *
 * > [...] The problem with object-oriented languages is theyâ€™ve got all
 * this implicit environment that they carry around with them.
 * You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding
 * the banana and the entire jungle.
 *
 * It can also lead to lead cohesion of the code, if interfaces and
 * implementations are only ever single-method oriented.
 *
 * Used reasonably and with attention to evolution pains, however, and
 * this is an indispensible part of object-oriented programming.
